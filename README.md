# DNA-encoder--written-in-R-
Aim to manipulate randomly generated DNA strands to encode them into RNA, then translate the sequence into proteins

The project is written in R to manipulate best de data obtain by the experiments
We can also write a DNA sequence that we need to analyze by includin a function commented
And we can also get the percentage of bases in the sequence
